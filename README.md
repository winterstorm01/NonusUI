# Mission statement
This is an addon collection for World of Warcraft that i([Nonus](http://nonus.net)) use when i play.

The aim here is to create addons that follow these criterias:
 * Configuration is done via `cfg.lua` that is located in each addonfolder so that the settings carry over no matter what character you are playing.
 * The general theme is to frame things in shadowy outline and have an opaque dark background on frames that need it.
 * Every addon is precedented with `nui` and is colored with `|cff90C3D4n|r|cff3399FFui|r`
